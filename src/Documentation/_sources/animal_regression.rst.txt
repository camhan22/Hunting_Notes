animal\_regression package
==========================

This package implements the OneClassSVM model from sklearn to determine whether the selected times, dates, and weather conditions will lead to seeing the specified species at that location

.. note::

   The OneClassSVM model may not be a good model for this application. It would be better for the model to predict how many of the desired species you should see instead of a yes or no. This is something I am working on.
